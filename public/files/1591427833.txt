This course aims to teach everyone the basics of programming computers using Python.
 We cover the basics of how one constructs a program from a series of simple instructions in Python.
 The course has no pre-requisites and avoids all but the simplest mathematics.
 Anyone with moderate computer experience should be able to master the materials in this course.

Variables and Expressions
A value is one of the fundamental things — like a letter or a number — that a program manipulates. 
Strings in Python can be enclosed in either single quotes (') or double quotes ("), or three of each (''' or """)

These values are classified into different classes, or data types: 4 is an integer, and "Hello, World!" is a string, 
so-called because it contains a string of letters. You (and the interpreter)
 can identify strings because they are enclosed in quotation marks.The values we have
 seen so far are 4 (the result when we added 2 + 2), and "Hello, World!".
 Q:what result we will get for this : type("3.2")?
<class 'str'>
<class 'int'>
Error
<class 'float'>
Q: what result we will get for this : type(3.2)?
<class 'float'>
